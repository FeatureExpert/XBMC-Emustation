Plot points that support this include Mr. Freeze still posing as a threat (as his appearance in The New Batman Adventures episode "Cold Comfort" was the last time he was seen prior to Batman Beyond), as well as the fact that Batgirl is the Dark Knight's only active sidekick in the game.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Bistro Cupid places you in the role of a young cooking prodigy with a mysterious past and an even more uncertain future. His father vanished without so much as a photograph to refresh the boy's fading memory, and his mother remains unwilling to offer any explanations as to why or how. What's a young cooking genius to do? Why, manage a bistro, of course. While Bistro Cupid does dabble in a number of different genres, the one common thread throughout the game and overall focus will be to establish and maintain a successful restaurant business. And in order to do so, you will need the freshest of ingredients, finest of recipes and the most suave of... dating skills? Since you can hardly be expected to run an entire bistro on your own, you will also receive the help of 12 impossibly cute anime girls, each with their own distinct personalities and style of cuisine. Not coincidentally, your bistro can be expanded up to 12 floors by skillfully budgeting your time and attention toward the girls. Keeping the restaurant running smoothly and the women happy, however, is bound to be a difficult juggling act.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Major League Baseball 2K5 debuts On Command Baserunning, that includes active picture-in-picture baserunning, and new gameplay features called Maximum Sliding and Baseburner Mode. Active picture-in-picture baserunning delivers both an exciting presentation style and an intuitive method to precisely control runners. The new baserunning mechanic utilizes the right analog thumbstick to choose how baserunners slide -- head or feet first -- in conjunction with hook sliding left or right of the base. Players will be able to reach a base quicker, get up more quickly from a slide, or avoid being tagged out with the new freedom found in Maximum Sliding. Baseburner Mode allows the gamer to play any 'at-bat' through the perspective of any baserunner, delivering precision control to gamers.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Exaskeleton is a linear mech-combat game. Each mission in the game is book-ended by long, talking-head dialogue scenes between the various members of Joe's party. Before each mission the model of Joe's (as well as allies, if available) frame can be selected, either the nimble and weak Light Frame, the armored and slow Heavy Frame, or the in between Middle Frame. Two weapon slots are taken up by small arms, either a pistol, machine gun, or grenades, while the other two slots are taken up by more powerful weapons, like missile launchers, sniper riffles, and Gatling guns, with the most powerful only able to be equipped by a Heavy Frame. Weapons have limited ammo and overheat if fired continuously. Each body part of a frame is armored, and after the armor on a part is destroyed any additional damage to that part will damage the frame itself, until eventually the frame is destroyed.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Fila World Tour Tennis is a tennis simulation with a focus on fast-pace matches. The heart of the game is the career mode where the player creates his character and starts on place 100 of the world ranking. To become number one he has to win matches and tournaments - but he is on a very limited budget. Every participation costs money and if the first match is no success the career is practically over. The player character also has stats which have an influence on the performance. These can be improved by buying better equipment or absolving costly training sessions which are mini games like hitting balls through rings. Other playing options are instant matches or single tournaments. The game features 50 pre-created player characters and 24 courts which have to be unlocked in the career mode. The license is restricted to the sportswear.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Featuring an enhanced version of the original's physics engine with even faster driving track designs, FlatOut 2 also boasts numerous improvements, enhancements and additions to make the title the definitive FlatOut experience. Twice as many vehicles, a more sophisticated career mode, additional race environments, double the number of tracks, twice as many mini-games along with brand new and much requested online multiplayer modes are just some of the exhaustive features that are included in FlatOut 2. With more than 5,000 fully destructible objects on every track as well as 40 deformable parts on each vehicle, physical interaction in a racing game is taken to unprecedented heights. With a greater emphasis placed on causing destruction on the track by offering greater rewards, game play will be even more frantic than ever. Drivers will need to tear into competitors' cars, trash the local scenery, litter the track with obstacles, while at the same time trying to concentrate on their own race in a bid to cross the line first. The ever-popular Ragdoll mini-games from the original FlatOut game make a welcome return and are better than ever with 12 Ragdoll events, a Ragdoll Championship and full online support. New Ragdoll events include basketball, baseball and royal flush cards.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City from the air?</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Group S Challenge is a racing game somewhere between arcade and simulation: the game focuses on delivering a realistic driving experience, e.g. with physics modeled after real life, but features simple controls. Gameplay itself features the usual playing modes: splitscreen-duels against another player, time races and an arcade mode with instant races against the AI. The most important mode however is the Circuit Mode which is basically a career: the player starts with a few credits and tries to become the most successful driver. There are five leagues which want to be won. Of course the player receives prize money after accomplishments which is reinvested into upgrade his car or buying a new one altogether. Besides the races there are two additional ways to receive rewards: Line-In races (following the shown ideal line) for money and Head-to-Head races against a single opponent for a new car.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Lego Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Mashed is a top-down vehicular combat racing video game, similar in style to Micro Machines, Circuit Breakers and Super Sprint. Each race consists of four vehicles. The player has to navigate various obstacles and obtain weapon pickups to succeed. The game operates a left-behind principle: the camera tries to keep all players in one screen, and if one drops far enough behind in the race, they are eliminated, and the other players race on. This continues until there is one player left, who is given two points, while the rest of the racers also gain or lose points depending on their final position in the round. The system then repeats until a player reaches a set number of points, usually 10 or 12. In multiplayer, knocked out players have the option of striking cars still racing with partially controlled missiles, known as airstrikes.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Metal Slug 5 is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK Playmore. It was released in 2003 for the MVS arcade platform, is the fifth game in the Metal Slug series, and was one of the last games for the Neo Geo system. The game was developed by Noise Factory/SNK Playmore, after Korean company Mega Enterprise had directed Metal Slug 4. The biggest difference from previous titles is the addition of the slide move, which allows the player to evade and maneuver in a new fashion. Unlike its predecessor Metal Slug 4, which reused many of the backgrounds from the previous games, Metal Slug 5 incorporates a wealth of new environments and backgrounds and features a more Heavy metal influenced soundtrack.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Playable by up to eight people in the same map online, Muzzle Flash is a simple game at its heart. The object is to find the enemy, flush him out and gun him down. The motif is decidedly military, and campaigns take place everywhere: forests, deserts, polar regions, etc. The left trigger locks on to a target, and A shoots. X reloads. B throws a grenade. Although the characters move slowly, there isn't a function to run. This game is all about positioning, angles and a little bit of luck. There are a lot of places to hide and plot your next move, and that seems to be what the game is about more than anything... tactics.</synopsis>

Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air, based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or air-out a fast break; dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, and spin; and much more. It's all happening in NBA 2K3.</synopsis>

Varying degrees of pressure can be selected - whether it's telling your teammate to shadow a selected opponent or deliver a big check - allowing players new defensive options on the fly. Pro Control in NHL 2K7 delivers the offensive and defensive options hockey fans have been asking for, truly delivering the next generation of hockey.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Team up with a cast of crazy critters, unleashing your animal instincts in Open Season, the game - a riotous romp in the great outdoors in which a rowdy brood of forest animals turns the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters. When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliott, he finds himself lost in the woods just three days before hunting season begins. Forced to "rough it" in the great outdoors, Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing. Interact with Beth, Shaw, and all your animal favorites from the Open Season film. Throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels, and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters. Roll in a giant snowball, ride the rapids on a floating outhouse, zip through tunnels in a crazy mine cart ride, and take on more madcap adventures as Boog discovers how to go from "Mild" to "Wild". Challenge your friends or team up together in 4-player mini-games.</synopsis>

Featuring 136 club teams and 57 national teams, Winning Eleven 8 offers gamers control of up to 4,500 of the world's greatest soccer players.

Pro Evolution Soccer 4 also features improvements to the popular Master League, which now has more strategy through player development and injury, and a new 'My Best Eleven' option so fans can save their greatest teams.</synopsis>

It is the fifth main installment in the Puyo Puyo puzzle game series and the second Puyo Puyo game to be programmed by Sonic Team after Puyo Pop (which was released just after the series' original developer, Compile, went bankrupt). Sega, which acquired the series' rights from Compile in 1998, published all the Japanese versions of the game; the game was scarcely released internationally, and certain versions were released by other publishers in those areas. Only the Nintendo GameCube and DS versions were released in North America; Europe received both versions plus the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable versions. The NAOMI port to Dreamcast, released only in Japan, was the last Dreamcast game developed by Sonic Team, as well as being the only console version to use sprites in place of 3D models.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>This latest chapter marks the return to the franchise's roots by reintroducing the deeply strategic and tactical gameplay synonymous with the Rainbow Six name, while incorporating classic in-game elements such as vintage maps and weapons, all rebuilt using today's technology. Rainbow Six Critical Hour's storyline bids on nostalgia as John Clark retires and passes the torch to Ding Chavez. Chosen by fans, eight single-player missions from the original Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear games return, revamped with today's technology. Return to tactical gameplay: Through slower pacing and an enhanced combat model, strategic planning is the central element of gameplay. Advanced combat model: Choose your steps wisely as your actions could mean the difference between life and death. Weapon accuracy is affected by in-game maneuvers and events such as running, crouching, standing still or firing while injured. Rainbow Six Critical Hour comes equipped with a superior multiplayer experience, including the revolutionary Persistent Elite Creation (P.E.C.) mode, as well as the new and innovative Assassin and Free-for-All modes. Close-quarter battles: Maps in narrow corridors with non-linear level design challenge even the most tactical of gamers, increasing the importance of the infamous one-shot kill. From Idaho to Venice, Mexico City to Siberia, team Rainbow travels the world to serve and protect the innocent from terrorist threats.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Reservoir Dogs is based on the 1992 Quentin Tarantino-directed classic movie about five total strangers who are brought together to carry out a diamond heist. The robbery goes wrong when the alarm is tripped and the cops show up. In the ensuing confusion, four of the robbers make it back to their warehouse rendezvous but it is quickly apparent that one of them is an undercover police officer - but which one? Staying true to the original plot, this intense, third person shooter follows the progress and planning of the famed diamond heist while filling in some of the cliffhanger questions from the film: What happened to Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown? Where did Mr. Pink hide the diamonds? What actually happened at the heist? These questions and more will be answered as the game unfolds and according to the player's tactics. Players get to fill the shoes of each iconic character in the film as they relive the Reservoir Dogs experience complete with the movie's trademark style and wit. The game will also feature the full and original soundtrack from the movie - the super sounds of the seventies brought alive with the thematic "Little Green Bag", "Stuck in the Middle with You" and more.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Rolling is an extreme sports video game released in 2003 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Subsequent Game Boy Advance and GameCube versions were cancelled due to a declining interest in extreme sports titles. To date, it is one of the few other games depicting aggressive inline skating apart from Aggressive Inline and the Jet Set Radio series. It was originally developed by the now defunct Rage Software, who were aiming to create a more authentic recreation of the sport (the box art claims the game features 250 tricks), unlike Aggressive Inline which focused on exaggerated, fantasy-themed levels and high scoring, fairly unrealistic tricks.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Shikigami no Shiro (Formula-God's Castle), released in North America under the title of Mobile Light Force 2 and in the PAL region as MLF2 - Mobile Light Force 2, is a 2001 shoot 'em up developed by Alfa System and is the first game in the Shikigami no Shiro series. It was originally released as an arcade game and later ported to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. The game was titled Shikigami no Shiro Evolution (式神の城 EVOLUTION) for its revised version for Xbox, which was then ported to Windows as Shikigami no Shiro EX. When localized, publisher XS Games re-titled the game as a sequel to Mobile Light Force, but in reality the games are unrelated. Mobile Light Force is known as Gunbird in Japan, and was not developed by Alfa System. On May 8th, 2017, Degica Games announced that they are localizing the series on their Twitter account. The first game will be released on Microsoft Windows via Steam on June 16th.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>This is not the ninth Shin Megami Tensei game; "nine" is the number of character attributes and alignments used in the game: Law, Chaos, Light, Dark, Neutral, and their variants. The game is set in the future. Tokyo, Japan's capital, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion early in the 21th century. But some years later the Tokyo of the nineties was digitally recreated. People live in a virtual world, and everything is ruled by computer programs. But some programs don't work correctly, and one day, a pop concert is disrupted by a terrible demonic vision. A special agency recruits the hero of the game, Kei (which can be either female or male, depending on your choice), to travel through the virtual world and to confront the hackers who might pull the strings behind the scene.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Two different extremes of tennis are combined here. The four Grand Slam venues are among the 11 featured, but so are a mansion and a dance hall. These surfaces all affect ball speed and bounce. A few real players such as Carlos Moya and Tim Henman are included, but most are created for the game - a lifeguard and a mayor are included, with abilities based on their real-life work. As well as playing individual Exhibition matches, you can take on an Arcade challenge of defeating the 16 players or take on the full Slam Tennis Championship event. Forehand, backhand and lob shots are all available. There are also sub-games: Crazy Collapsing Columns, Bubble Bursting Bonanza, Rocking Ring Riot, and Sand, Sea and Serve.</synopsis>

Three distinct types of gameplay -- Flying, Rescue, and Combat -- will keep the action constant and the challenges relentless. Play both film-inspired missions as well as original content created exclusively for the videogame. Graphics, sound, and gameplay have been taken to the next level to create a Metropolis like you've never seen it, with three dimensional sound, a complete orchestra soundtrack, and Oscar-wining sound designer.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world. The game features 5 different game modes: Arcade. where the player competes freely on any of available tracks, Tour de France, where the player aims to win the prestigious competition in five years, by training and winning enough money to afford better bike parts and training sessions, Time Trial (racing against the clock) and train basic skills. As the player is controlling a bike, it isn't just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won't immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes), advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized "targeting" and "push and shove" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's FIFA Manager.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>Volvo: Drive For Life is a rather interesting game, for one whose primary purpose is that as an advertisment for Volvo's current product line. Volvo, an auto maker that has until recently, been largely ignored in the realm of racing games, suddenly has found its more recent (and uncharacteristically streamlined) vehicles in a number of racing titles such as Forza Motorsport, Rallisport Challenge 2, and Gran Turismo 4 (which contains the unexpected inclusion of a 1988 Volvo 240 GLT station wagon). Therefore, it is not so surprising to see Volvo turn up with its own videogame on one hand. On the other... how did Volvo, of all companies, decided to do such a thing? Luckily, for Volvo's sake, this game isn't a complete disappointment at all. The control, despite not being able to be configured to the user's tastes, is solid, and rather reminiscent of Sega Rally, if only a little tighter and realistic on the roads. This is crucial, as the driving exercises placed in this game have an emphasis on precision (and at times, Volvo's benchmark safety). While you won't have to sit at your desk and figure out what the exact turning apex of each car you use will be, the vehicle-specific exercises will give novice to intermediate drivers a work-out.</synopsis>

		<synopsis>In Without Warning, a radical terrorist group has targeted and seized the Peterson-Daniels Chemical Facility, a vulnerable location that jeopardizes millions of people from the devastating ecological hazard it imposes if destroyed. Pleas are useless and any direct military assault would be too great a risk. As terrified hostages fearfor their lives, their only hope lies with a covert operations team, whose goal is to infiltrate the plant and eliminate the merciless enemy. The harrowing events unfold over a 12 hour period, featuring a unique gameplay dynamic which enables the six central characters to experience events across the same timeline but from their own distinct viewpoints. The player controls each character individually, with the focus automatically shifting to a new character at key moments which are unfolded throughcut scenes. By switching between the characters, their individual tales are woven together to create an overall picture of the events that happened during the crisis. The player will also retrospectively view events through the eyes of another character and is therefore not only a participant in the events, but a spectator as well. Furthermore, actions performed as one character affect the progress of others and players must successfully utilize the strengths of each in order to advance.</synopsis>
